# Third-party audio libraries

* In order to be used by fmedia all these libraries must be built in a specific way - with plain and simple make files rather than with the official (sometimes unnecessarily huge and complex) make files.
* Sometimes the call to configure script is necessary to generate header files.
* For each library there's a wrapper that provides a different API that's easier to use and more suitable for fmedia.
* For some of the wrappers to work correctly we require quite large patches to original code.  The downside is that it's hard to upgrade those libs.
* The functionality that's not used by fmedia is either removed or disabled; fmedia doesn't use the official include files.
* The resulting binaries aren't compatible with any applications that use the official builds, so to eliminate ambiguity the file names have "-ff" suffix, e.g. "libNAME-ff.so".
